## my journey from noob to discord mod

[ctrl~]  opens terminal in vsCode
$ node -v  //tells you what version of node.js you have, mine is v16.13.2

$ npm init //gives you a package.json file, keeping track of dependencies

$ npm install discord.js

//skipped the linter 

$ npm install dotenv //let's you use a .env file to hide your token when githubbing

$ npm install @discordjs/builders @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
